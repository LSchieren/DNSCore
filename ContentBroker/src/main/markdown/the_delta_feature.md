# The delta mechanism

Users who want to use the delta mechanism should be accustomed how the concepts
of [objects](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#object) 
and [packages](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#package) 
relate to each other in the context of the DNSCore software.

## Deltas

Whenever a [SIP](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/sip_specification.md) is ingested into the DA-NRW, the resulting [AIP](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/specification_aip.md) is considered the first [package](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#package) of a newly created [object](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/object_model.md#object). It is possible to add more packages to the object, e. g. packages containing additional files, newer versions of files already ingested or an updated version of the contract rights. These packages are called *delta* packages. Delta packages can be built exactly like other SIPs and are processed by the ContentBroker like any other SIP (in terms of conversion, publication etc.), with one exception: No new identifier or URN will be created for the package; instead, the package is assigned to the already existing object it belongs to and inherits the corresponding identifier and URN.

## Ingest of delta packages

Delta packages doesn't differ from other SIPs in structure and can also be created via the [SIP-Builder](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/sip_specification.md#sip-builder). A package is recognized as a delta package by its filename. There a two possible naming conventions suitable for creating delta packages:

1. The package file has the same name as the first delivered package of the object.
2. The package file is named after the identifier of the object it belongs to.

A delta package should not be ingested before a previously delivered package of the same object is processed successfully by the ContentBroker.

## Use cases
### Adding files

You can add files to an object by simply delivering a delta package which contains the new files.

Example:

	myPackage.zip (First package)
		myPackage/
			bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture1.png
				picture2.png
				premis.xml
				
	myPackage.zip (Second package, named like the first one)
		myPackage/
			bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture3.png
				premis.xml
				
	 1-2014031047417.tar (DIP)
	 	1-2014031047417/
	 		bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture1.tif
				picture2.tif
				picture3.tif
				premis.xml

The three PNG files are converted to TIF files during ingest. The resulting DIP contains the newest (i. e. converted) versions of the files included in package 1 (picture1.tif, picture2.tif) and the newest version of the file included in package 2 (picture3.tif). It also contains the newest PREMIS file available: in this case, the newest PREMIS file is the premis.xml included in the second package.

### Replacing files

It is also possible to replace existing files with updated versions of these files. As already ingested files should never be deleted in a long term preservation system, the older file is not deleted from the storage device, but replaced *logically* by the newer file: DIPs will only contain the newer file, and only the newer file will be published.

Example:

	myPackage.zip (First package)
		myPackage/
			bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture1.png
				picture2.png
				premis.xml
				
	myPackage.zip (Second package, named like the first one)
		myPackage/
			bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture2.png
				premis.xml
				
	 1-2014031047417.tar (DIP)
	 	1-2014031047417/
	 		bag-info.txt
			bagit.txt
			manifest-md5.txt
			tagmanifest-md5.txt
			data/
				picture1.tif	(Package 1 version)
				picture2.tif	(Package 2 version)
				premis.xml

If a delta package contains a file named like a file already existing in a previously delivered package, the older file is replaced logically by the newer file. Please note that the file extension is not considered part of the file name in this case: If two files have different file extensions while sharing the same base name (e. g. "document.pdf" and "document.doc"), these files are considered homonymous. Before planning to replace files using the delta feature, please read the paragraph about [substitution rules](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/specification_dip.md#substitution-rules-and-surface-view-of-an-object) carefully.

### Replacing the contract

When building delta packages, it is important to know that only the premis.xml delivered in the newest package is used for determining the contract rights of an object.  
Just like every other SIP, each delta package needs to contain a valid PREMIS file. If you want to keep the settings of the originally delivered package, just copy the rights section from the original premis.xml, or choose the same rights settings again when building the SIP via the SIP-Builder. Alternatively, you can include a PREMIS file with different settings in order to change the contract rights (e. g. add a footer text or allow publication). Please note that the new settings will be valid for the contents of the whole object and not just for the contents of the delta package!  
It is not necessary to add data files to a delta package if you just want to change the contract. A SIP containing just a single premis.xml is a valid SIP (while a SIP containing just other data and no premis.xml is not).

## Deltas and metadata

If the originally delivered package contains a metadata file, an updated version of the file needs to be contained in the delta package. Just like the premis.xml, the new metadata file has to apply to the whole object and not just the contents of the delta package (e. g. the *fileSec* element of a mets.xml file needs to reference the files of the original package *and* the delta package(s)).  
However, this is not true for sidecar files (like [XMP files](https://github.com/da-nrw/DNSCore/blob/master/ContentBroker/src/main/markdown/specification_sip.md#xmp)): You only have to include sidecar files if the corresponding base files are also included in the delta package.

## Deltas and long term preservation

As mentioned above, already ingested data is only deleted under exceptional circumstances. To ensure that delta files never overwrite existing files, each package of an object is stored as a separate AIP. They are combined inside the working directory at certain occasions (e. g. retrieval, transfer to presentation repository), but are kept at different locations on the storage device.  
However, there is one downside to this approach: In case of a fatal database damage, the objects may need to be reconstructed manually out of the different package files. Therefore it is planned to merge the packages of an object to a single AIP at regular intervals (without deleting the original packages). The feature will be implemented in a future version of the ContentBroker.
